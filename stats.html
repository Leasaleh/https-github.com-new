         <h2>Speed of the Internet</h2>
         <p> In the 1990s the only way to access the Internet was by using modems that are connected to standard telephone lines. In the early 1993, the fasted modem had a speed of 14.4 kilobits per second. In 1994, the modem was doubled for a speed of 28.8k. Then, the 33.6k modem was introduced in 1996 followed by a 56k modem in 1998. In March 2000, ADSL Home Broadband were introduced, which had a speed of 512k per second, hence nine times faster than the 56k modem, however it was rather expensive. In August 2003, a 1Mb/s connection speed was launched by BT. In early 2005, the speed doubled to 2Mb which was then more optamize in March 2006 to attain 8Mb/s. In 2011 a 100Mb/s fibre broadband was offered for the first time in Milton Keynes in 2011. A 500Mb/s fibre service began rise in 2015.[14]
             In 2024, UAE was the country in the middle east with the fastest internet speed of 441.89 Mbps, followed by Qatar with a speed of 358.27 Mbps and Kuwait at 263.59 Mbps and then Egypt with a speed of 24.17 Mbps.[15]</p>
